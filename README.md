## Overview
This project objectives to increase a predictive version that classifies SONAR-detected objects as either "Rock" or "Mine." Utilizing a Logistic Regression version, we are able to examine SONAR records to become aware of functions that differentiate these categories, improving programs like underwater exploration and army operations.

## Objectives
Data Collection: Acquire a categorized dataset of SONAR readings containing times of rocks and mines.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the records, addressing missing values and outliers to make certain great.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the SONAR records through statistical analysis and transformation.
Model Development: Implement and train a Logistic Regression model the usage of Python, optimizing its performance.
Model Evaluation: Assess accuracy, precision, consider, and F1 score to ensure dependable predictions.

## Deployment: Prepare the model for real-time predictions, processing incoming SONAR information correctly.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the dataset, doing away with beside the point functions and managing lacking information.

Model Training: Train the Logistic Regression version with scikit-study on the processed dataset.

Testing and Validation: Evaluate the model using a separate test set.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, keep in mind, and F1 score to evaluate overall performance.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-analyze
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or a desired IDE

## Expected Outcomes
We aim to broaden a Logistic Regression version that appropriately classifies SONAR information as "Rock" or "Mine," supplying insights into distinguishing capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project will contribute notably to item detection the usage of SONAR information, improving accuracy and supplying insights for numerous applications.
